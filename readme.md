# Game Controller

This is my attempt to make a custom PC game controller which has all of the regular buttons expected as well as has the ability to switch the positions of the face buttons between the Nintendo and Xbox conventions.

## [V1.0 - Initial Idea](V1.0)
- [Readme](V1.0/readme.md)
- [Schematic](V1.0/circuit.png)

This is the first iteration of the controller design based on my limited electronics experience which uses an Arduino Nano 33 BLE.

## [V1.1 - Intial Revision](V1.1)
- [Readme](V1.1/readme.md)
- [Schematic](V1.1/schematic.png)
- [Code](V1.1/code/code.ino)

This is the second iteration updated with feedback from coworkers from my inital version.

## [V1.2 - Second Revision](V1.2)
- [Readme](V1.2/readme.md)
- [Controller Schematic](V1.2/schematic-Controller.png)
- [Power Schematic](V1.2/schematic-Power.png)
- [Code](V1.2/code/code.ino)

This is the third iteration where I added in a voltage regulator component.

## [V2.0 - Third Revision](V2.0)
- [Readme](V2.0/readme.md)
- [Schematic](V2.0/schematic.png)
- [Code](V2.0/code/code.ino)

This is the fourth iteration which changes the microcontroller to the Arduino Micro since the joystick library I want to use doesn't support the Arduino Nano 33 BLE.
